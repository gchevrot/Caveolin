# Distribution of molecules on the surface of a sphere 

Using quaternions this notebook can be used to distribute 6 caveolins on 
the surface of a sphere.

Future work:
It should be easy to extent the capabilities of this notebook to distribute
more molecules uniformely on the surface of a sphere.
